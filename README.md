# GDP-Multiple-Regression-Model
This is a Multiple Regression Model in RStudio and RMarkdown with packages and libraries such as ggplot2, dplyr, Hmisc, corrplot, car, olsrr, and MASS. Used mathematical statistics principles to create a complete research presentation on GDP per capita in USD and it's significant contributors.

## Background:

GDP is important to predict because it provides key insights into the financial health and stability of a nation. The success of a country’s economy is an indicator of the well-being of the general population. If the economy is good, it means that people have elevated incomes and can contribute to the consumption of goods and services that in turn provides jobs that allow people to exit poverty and further contribute to the growth
of the economy (Sen, 2021). Lower fertility rates indicate that parents have higher incomes that they can invest in higher quality (and more expensive) education and childcare for fewer children (Doepke, 2022). Low population growth rates indicate more labor, which leads to higher productivity, meaning more goods and services are available for consumption, leading to an improvement in the performance of an economy (Population, n.d.). High Dependency rates indicate less people in the workforce, and a less supported economy.

    1. Do countries with high fertility rates have lower GDPs on average?
    2. Do countries with low population growth rates have lower GDPs on average?
    3. Do countries with high dependency rate have lower GDPs on average?

## Data Description:

### WHO: 
Our dataset uses data collected by the US Census Bureau and Focus Economics.

### WHAT: 
The Census Bureau collects population, growth, fertility rate, life expectancy, and sex ratio data. Focus Economics collects data on GDP growth, inflation, and exchange rates.

### WHEN: 
The US Census Bureau’s International Database was last updated in 2023, with individual countries updating their data periodically. The United States is mandated by the Constitution in Article I, Section 2 to count each resident in the country every 10 years on years that end in ‘0’ (International Database, 2023) and other countries have similar methods of conducting new census investigations. Focus Economics collects updated data monthly from around 3,500 international forecasts.

### WHY: 
The U.S. uses census data for Electoral College votes allocation and distributing over
